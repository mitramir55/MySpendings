# (Personal) Financial Analysis
In the past few months I've been tracking my costs and revenue. In the early days I mostly wanted to become independant and have full control over my bank accounts and revenues. tTese days in quarantine has given us all, some time to rethink our lives and our decisions. 
So as a data driven researcher and data visualization lover, I thought maybe I can get some insights from all the data that I've collected. So I wrote this notebook to first analyze myself and then maybe help a few other people get their own analysis tools and vision!
This is a view of my excel spreadsheet. I'll leave a link to where you can download it.

Some vizualizations from inside the notebook:

Here is a clean representation besed on week day, date and month of each spending:
